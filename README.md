For this class we explored secure coding principles. In order to do this we spent time learning about some coding issues and learning how to mitigate them. I have checked in all of our individual coding projcts.

We also created a sample security policy. For each item in the policy we explained the possible threat, gave examples of good and bad code. We also spacified the threat level, likelihood of this, and the mitigation effort. 

We then created a presentation from the security policy.
